# toy-shop
A year 2 assignment at Northumbria University (2021). Scored 95/100.

The assignment was about web programming. To complete the assignment we needed to utilise PHP, JavaScript and AJAX to create a working toy website. The assignment did not require any CSS.

This was a fun assignment and helped me become more confident with PHP and Javascript. If I was to go back I would love to add some styling to the website and organise the code.
